            With each project, my aim is to best engage my audience for an impactful user-experience.
            I applied aspects of UX and agile development in a recent project where I worked in a team of four
            to develop a single-page MERN app that helps local business owners track their sales, inventory and
            attendance at specialty events. Excited to leverage skills in the future as part of a fast-paced,
            quality-driven
            team in order to build better experiences on the web.
